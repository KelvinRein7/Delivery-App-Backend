Delivery App Backend
---------------------

- It is a terminal-based delivery app. 

- The whole idea of the app is to let the customer view available franchises, drivers and all other information (locations, IDs, etc...) and let them make an order. 

- Then, the closest franchise will receive the order and the closest driver will be assigned
to pick up the order. 

- The driver then delivers it to the customer's location. It almost sounds like UBEREATS. :D
                                                        
Compiling Instruction
---------------------

Since I have created a makefile that compiles and links all code into a single executable,
you can just go to the directory that contains all the files and
        
Open your Terminal,

	Step 1) make
	Step 2) ./app

Then you will given options to play around with it. ENJOY!
